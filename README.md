# Millionaire
### A basic "Who wants to be a millionaire" game

## About the game

This is a basic version of the popular "Who wants to be a millionaire" game, made as a project for my Introduction to Programming class. It's also my very first project.
The game consists of three main modes:

### The game mode

The game mode includes a category menu which lets the user pick a category. That determines the topic of the questions in the game. Then, the game starts. It consists of 10 levels, each of which presents a question with four possible answers and three lifelines, which the player chooses from. A lifeline of a certain type can be used just once in the same game. Also, if a lifelne has been used in a question, the user has no access to the other possibly available lifelines untill the next questtion. If the player has answered to all of the ten questions correctly, they win.

### The create mode

The create mode lets the user create their own question, suggest four possible answers, select the correct one, choose the topic and the level of difficulty, and then the question is being included in the game.

### The edit mode

If the user enters the edit mode, they can select an existing question and modify it as they prefer, they can also change the possible answers and select a new correct answer. 
Then, the old version of the question is removed and the new one is added, instead.




### Notes

Currently, the game will work only on Windows OS.
The questions are still just 100, the user is able to add as many as they wish.
Each question is stored in one of the 10 text files, depending on the level of difficulty.

### Cons 

The code can possibly be optimized even more than currently.
